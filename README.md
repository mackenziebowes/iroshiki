# Iroshiki - Indexed Palettes For The Web

## The Name

色 | Iro = "Color", used euphemistically for type, timbre, mood, and beauty as in beautiful women.
式 | Shiki = "Method", collides with "system," "formula," "equation," as in English, in addition to "function" and just so happens to also collide with "ceremony," "event," "celebration," ie "party" (including Weddings!)

So - take your pick! There's homophony and semantic collision to play with. "Color System" was the intention, but it can also mean "mood ritual" and "sexy party" which is what a colour system should be!
